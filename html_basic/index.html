<h1> Falling in Love with the Problem:</h1>
<h2> Embrace the Challenge </h2>
  <p> Shift Perspective: Instead of seeing problems as roadblocks, view them as opportunities to create positive change.</p>
  <p>Curiosity is Key: Approach problems with an inquisitive mind. Ask "why" and "how" to truly understand the root cause.</p>
  
<h3>Deep Dive & Understanding:</h3>
  <p>Research & Empathy: Immerse yourself in the problem. Talk to people affected, gather data, and understand the context. </p>
  <p> Define the Scope: Clearly define the problem you're solving. What are its boundaries and who are the stakeholders? </p>
